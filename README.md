## week-5-homework

This week I was tasked with making a daily work planner. It uses time and local storage to accomplish the tasks.
By typing out your task to the corrisponding hour and clicking the flag it will save the text.
It uses real time to change the tasks colors. Blue is upcoming, yellow is current, green is past.

I enjoyed this assignment and did not have any difficult problems or things I could not handle.
Though I do feel there is probably a more efficent way of writing the script.
